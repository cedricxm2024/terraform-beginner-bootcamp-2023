# Bug Fix Documentation

## Critical Terraform Configuration Bugs Fixed

### Date: 2025-10-27

### Bugs Identified and Fixed:

#### 1. **Syntax Error in S3 Bucket Name (Line 23)**
**Severity:** Critical - Prevents deployment

**Issue:**
```hcl
bucket = cedric-gamning-site.random_string.suffix.result
```

**Problem:** 
- Missing quotes around bucket name
- Invalid syntax for string interpolation
- Typo: "gamning" instead of "gaming"

**Fix:**
```hcl
bucket = "cedric-gaming-site-${random_string.suffix.result}"
```

**Impact:** Without this fix, Terraform would fail with a syntax error during plan/apply.

---

#### 2. **Wrong Resource Reference in CloudFront (Line 104)**
**Severity:** Critical - Prevents CloudFront deployment

**Issue:**
```hcl
target_origin_id = aws_s3_bucket.site_bucket.id
```

**Problem:** 
- References non-existent resource `site_bucket`
- Actual resource name is `gameing_bucket`

**Fix:**
```hcl
target_origin_id = aws_s3_bucket.gameing_bucket.id
```

**Impact:** CloudFront distribution would fail to create due to invalid origin reference.

---

#### 3. **Missing Required CloudFront Restrictions Block**
**Severity:** Critical - Invalid CloudFront configuration

**Issue:**
CloudFront distribution was missing the required `restrictions` block.

**Fix:**
```hcl
restrictions {
  geo_restriction {
    restriction_type = "none"
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Terraform would fail validation without this required block.

---

#### 4. **Conflicting S3 ACL Configuration**
**Severity:** High - Security misconfiguration

**Issue:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  acl = "public-read"
  # ...
}
```

While also having:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "gameing_bucket_block" {
  block_public_acls = true
  # ...
}
```

**Problem:**
- Attempting to set public-read ACL while blocking public access
- Deprecated ACL parameter usage
- CloudFront with OAC should handle access, not public ACLs

**Fix:**
Removed `acl = "public-read"` from both S3 objects. Access is properly managed through CloudFront OAC.

**Impact:** Prevents deployment conflicts and follows AWS security best practices.

---

#### 5. **Missing forwarded_values in CloudFront Cache Behavior**
**Severity:** Medium - Required for proper caching

**Issue:**
CloudFront default_cache_behavior was missing forwarded_values configuration.

**Fix:**
```hcl
forwarded_values {
  query_string = false
  cookies {
    forward = "none"
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Ensures proper cache behavior for static website content.

---

## Validation Results

After fixes:
- ✅ `terraform fmt` - All files properly formatted
- ✅ `terraform init` - Successfully initialized
- ✅ `terraform validate` - Configuration is valid

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run `terraform plan` with valid AWS credentials and user_uuid
2. Verify S3 bucket naming follows AWS conventions
3. Test CloudFront distribution creation
4. Verify website accessibility through CloudFront domain
5. Confirm S3 objects are properly uploaded

## Additional Notes

- All fixes maintain existing functionality while correcting syntax and configuration errors
- Security posture improved by removing conflicting public ACL settings
- Configuration now follows AWS and Terraform best practices
